# Optimization Methods for Data Science Course

Welcome to the repository for the Optimization Methods for Data Science course, which I attended at the University of Vienna! üòä This repository contains materials related to the lectures and exercises for the course. Contents:

- Fundamentals of convex analysis
- First-order methods: gradient descent, subgradient method, acceleration, adaptivity, etc.
- Stochastic first-order methods: stochastic gradient descent, variance reduction
- Higher-order methods: Newton's method, quasi-Newton method

## Contents
